/**
 * This C++ program prints "Hello SLAM" to the console.
 * 
 * @param argc The `argc` parameter in the `main` function stands for "argument count" and represents
 * the number of arguments passed to the program when it is executed from the command line. It includes
 * the name of the program itself as the first argument.
 * @param argv argv is a pointer to an array of C-strings (char*) representing the command-line
 * arguments passed to the program when it is executed. The first element (argv[0]) usually contains
 * the name of the program itself. The argc parameter represents the number of arguments passed to the
 * program.
 * 
 * @return The `main` function is returning an integer value of 0.
